diagrams using the geometric version of auction algorithm.

Wasserstein distance $W_{q, p}(X, Y)$ between two persistent diagrams is
the minimum over all perfect matchings between $X$ and $Y$ ( $y(x)$ is the point of $Y$
matched to $x \in X$ ) of the following expression:
$ ( \sum \| x - y(x) \|_p ^ { q } ) ^ { 1 / q} $

# Dependencies

Requires boost 1.58 or higher.
Your compiler must support C++11.

# Usage:

To use a standalone command-line utility wasserstein_dist:

wasserstein_dist file1 file2  [wasserstein degree] [relative error] [internal norm]. 

Parameter wasserstein degree corresponds to $q$, when it tends to infinity,
Wasserstein distance tends to the bottleneck distance.

If two diagrams are equal, then the exact distance 0.0 is printed (the order
of points in file1 and file2 need not be the same).
Otherwise the output is an approximation of the exact distance. Precisely:
if d_exact is the true distance and d_approx is the output, then 

    | d_exact - d_approx | / d_exact < relative_error.

Parameter internal_p corresponds to p.

Default values: 
wasserstein_degree  = 1.0, 
relative_error = 0.01, 
internal_p = infinity.

Valid values: 
wasserstein_degree must be in $[1.0, \infinity)$, 
relative_error must be positive,
internal_p must be in $[1.0, \infinity]$ (to explicitly set internal_p to $\infinity$, supply inf).By default wasserstein degree is 1.0, relative error is 0.01, internal norm is l_infinity.

file1 and file2 must contain persistence diagrams in plain text format 
(one point per line, empty lines are ignored, comments can be made with #):

# this is how your input can look like
x_1 y_1 # two real numbers per line
...
# empty lines or comments are ignored
x_n y_n 

To use from your code:

#include "wasserstein.h"

// All classes and functions are in geom_ws namespace

std::vector<std::pair<double, double>> diagram1, diagram2;
// any container class that supports range-for loops will do.
// A pair represents a single point, 
// first component = x-coordinate,
// second component = y-coordinate.
// ...
// load your diagrams into diagram1, diagram2 (off-diagonal points).
// You can use function readDiagramPointSet:
geom_ws::readDiagramPointSet("diagram1.txt", diagram1);
geom_ws::readDiagramPointSet("diagram2.txt", diagram1);
// ...
// to get the distance:
double wsDist = geom_ws::wassersteinDist(diagram1, diagram2, q, delta, p);
// q is wasserstein degree, delta is relative error,
// p is the internal norm in Wasserstein distance, defaults to infinity

Necessary projections (diagonal points) will be added in the wassersteinDist
function.

# Building

CMakeLists.txt in the root directory can be used to make the library (contained 
in wasserstein/src/ directory) and the command-line utility (in wasserstein/example/ directory)
to compute the distance between two diagrams in txt files.

On Linux/Mac:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

On Windows (checked with Visual Studio 2015, Community version)
use cmake-gui to create the solution in build directory and build it with VS.
