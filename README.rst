==========
giotto-tda
==========

``giotto-tda`` is a high-performance topological machine learning toolbox in Python built on top of
``scikit-learn`` and is distributed under the GNU AGPLv3 license. It is part of the `Giotto <https://github.com/giotto-ai>`_
family of open-source projects.

Project genesis
===============

``giotto-tda`` is the result of a collaborative effort between `L2F SA <https://www.l2f.ch/>`_,
the `Laboratory for Topology and Neuroscience <https://www.epfl.ch/labs/hessbellwald-lab/>`_ at EPFL,
and the `Institute of Reconfigurable & Embedded Digital Systems (REDS) <https://heig-vd.ch/en/research/reds>`_ of HEIG-VD.

License
=======

.. _L2F team: business@l2f.ch

``giotto-tda`` is distributed under the AGPLv3 `license <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.
If you need a different distribution license, please contact the `L2F team`_.

Documentation
=============

Please visit `https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs <https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs>`_ and navigate to the version you are interested in.

Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

The latest stable version of ``giotto-tda`` requires:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy (>= 1.19.1)
- SciPy (>= 1.5.0)
- joblib (>= 0.16.0)
- scikit-learn (>= 0.23.1)
- pyflagser (>= 0.4.3)
- python-igraph (>= 0.8.2)
- plotly (>= 4.8.2)
- ipywidgets (>= 7.5.1)

To run the examples, jupyter is required.

User installation
-----------------

The simplest way to install ``giotto-tda`` is using ``pip``   ::

    python -m pip install -U giotto-tda

If necessary, this will also automatically install all the above dependencies. Note: we recommend
upgrading ``pip`` to a recent version as the above may fail on very old versions.

Pre-release, experimental builds containing recently added features, and/or
bug fixes can be installed by running   ::

    python -m pip install -U giotto-tda-nightly

The main difference between ``giotto-tda-nightly`` and the developer installation (see the section
on contributing, below) is that the former is shipped with pre-compiled wheels (similarly to the stable
release) and hence does not require any C++ dependencies. As the main library module is called ``gtda`` in
both the stable and nightly versions, ``giotto-tda`` and ``giotto-tda-nightly`` should not be installed in
the same environment.

Developer installation
----------------------

Please consult the `dedicated page <https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/latest/installation.html#developer-installation>`_
for detailed instructions on how to build ``giotto-tda`` from sources across different platforms.
