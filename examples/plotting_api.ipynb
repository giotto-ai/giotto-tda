    "\n",
    "`giotto-tda` includes a set of plotting functions and class methods, powered by `plotly`. The library's plotting API is designed to facilitate the exploration of intermediate results in pipelines by harnessing the highly visual nature of topological signatures.\n",

    "This notebook is a quick tutorial on how to use `giotto-tda`'s plotting functionalities and unified plotting API. The plotting functions in `gtda.mapper` are not covered here as they are somewhat tailored to the Mapper algorithm, see the [dedicated tutorial](https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/dev/notebooks/mapper_quickstart.html).\n",

However, unless the additional degree of control is necessary, `plot` methods should be preferred as they often exploit class parameters and/or attributes (e.g. those computed during `fit`) to automatically fill some parameters in the corresponding functions."

    "In the diagram, each point indicates a topological feature in the data which appears at a certain \"birth\" scale and remains present all the way up to a later \"death\" scale. A point's distance from the diagonal is directly proportional to the difference between the point's \"death\" and its \"birth\". Hence, this distance visually communicates how \"persistent\" the associated topological feature is. Topological features are partitioned by dimension using colors: above, features in dimension 0 are red while those in dimension 1 are green. In dimension 0, the diagram describes connectivity structure in the data in a very similar way to linkage clustering: we see three points along the vertical axis, which are in one-to-one correspondence with \"merge\" events in the sense of hierarchical clustering. In dimension 1, the diagram describes the presence of \"independent\" one-dimensional holes in the data: as expected, there are only two significant points, corresponding to the two \"persistent\" circles."
