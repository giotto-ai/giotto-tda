    "The first step in analysing the topology of time series is to construct a _**time delay embedding**_ or _**Takens embedding**_, named after [Floris Takens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floris_Takens) who pioneered its use in the study of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takens's_theorem). A time delay embedding can be thought of as sliding a \"window\" of fixed size over a signal, with each window represented as a point in a (possibly) higher-dimensional space. A simple example is shown in the animation below, where pairs of points in a 1-dimensional signal are mapped to coordinates in a 2-dimensional embedding space. \n",

The quantity $(d-1)\\tau$ is known as the \"window size\" and the difference between $t_{i+1}$ and $t_i$ is called the **_stride_**. In other words, the time delay embedding of $f$ with parameters $(d,\\tau)$ is the function\n",
