    "# Topology in time series forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how ``giotto-tda`` can be used to create topological features for time series forecasting tasks, and how to integrate them into ``scikit-learn``–compatible pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will concentrate on topological features which are created from consecutive **sliding windows** over the data. In sliding window models, a single time series array ``X`` of shape ``(n_timestamps, n_features)`` is turned into a time series of windows over the data, with a new shape ``(n_windows, n_samples_per_window, n_features)``. There are two main issues that arise when building forecasting models with sliding windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``n_windows`` is smaller than ``n_timestamps``. This is because we cannot have more windows than there are timestamps without padding ``X``, and this is not done by ``giotto-tda``. ``n_timestamps - n_windows`` is even larger if we decide to pick a large stride between consecutive windows.\n",
    "2. The target variable ``y`` needs to be properly \"aligned\" with each window so that the forecasting problem is meaningful and e.g. we don't \"leak\" information from the future. In particular, ``y`` needs to be \"resampled\" so that it too has length ``n_windows``.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with these issues, ``giotto-tda`` provides a selection of transformers with ``resample``, ``transform_resample`` and ``fit_transform_resample`` methods. These are inherited from a ``TransformerResamplerMixin`` base class. Furthermore, ``giotto-tda`` provides a drop-in replacement for ``scikit-learn``'s ``Pipeline`` which extends it to allow chaining ``TransformerResamplerMixin``s with regular ``scikit-learn`` estimators.\n",

    "The first part of [Topology of time series](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda/blob/master/examples/time_series_classification.ipynb) explains a commonly used technique for converting a univariate time series into a single **point cloud**. Since topological features can be extracted from any point cloud, this is a gateway to time series analysis using topology. The second part of that notebook shows how to transform a *batch* of time series into a batch of point clouds, and how to extract topological descriptors from each of them independently. While in that notebook this is applied to a time series classification task, in this notebook we are concerned with topology-powered *forecasting* from a single time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning by analogy with the multivariate case above, we can look at sliding windows over ``X`` as small time series in their own right and track the evolution of *their* topology against the variable of interest (or against itself, if we are interested in unsupervised tasks such as anomaly detection).\n",

    "1. We can first apply a ``SlidingWindow``, and then an instance of ``TakensEmbedding``.\n",
