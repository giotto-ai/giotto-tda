    "# Topological feature extraction from graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "``giotto-tda`` can extract topological features from undirected or directed graphs represented as adjacency matrices, via the following transformers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [VietorisRipsPersistence](https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/latest/modules/generated/homology/gtda.homology.VietorisRipsPersistence.html) and [SparseRipsPersistence](https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/latest/modules/generated/homology/gtda.homology.VietorisRipsPersistence.html) initialized with ``metric=\"precomputed\"``, for undirected graphs;\n",
    "- [FlagserPersistence](https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/latest/modules/generated/homology/gtda.homology.VietorisRipsPersistence.html) initialized with ``directed=True``, for directed graphs, and with ``directed=False`` for undirected ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we build some basic intuition on how these methods are able to capture structures and patterns from such graphs. We will focus on the multi-scale nature of the information contained in the final outputs (\"persistence diagrams\"), as well as on the differences between the undirected and directed cases. Although adjacency matrices of sparsely connected and even unweighted graphs can be passed directly to these transformers, they are interpreted as *weighted* adjacency matrices according to some non-standard conventions. We will highlight these conventions below.\n",

    "### General API\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a collection ``X`` of adjacency matrices of graphs, you can instantiate transformers of class ``VietorisRipsPersistence`` or ``SparseRipsPersistence`` by setting the parameter ``metric`` as ``\"precomputed\"``, and then call ``fit_transform`` on ``X` to obtain the corresponding collection of *persistence diagrams* (see **Understanding the computation** below for an explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of ``VietorisRipsPersistence``, ``X`` can be a list of sparse or dense matrices, and a basic example of topological feature extraction would look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Instantiate topological transformer\n",
    "VR = VietorisRipsPersistence(metric=\"precomputed\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute persistence diagrams corresponding to each graph in X\n",
    "diagrams = VR.fit_transform(X)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry in the result can be plotted as follows (where we plot the 0th entry, i.e. `diagrams[0]`):\n",
    "```\n",
    "VR.plot(diagrams, sample=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: ``SparseRipsPersistence`` implements an approximate scheme for computing the same topological quantities as ``VietorisRipsPersistence``. This can be useful for speeding up the computation on large inputs, but we will not demonstrate its use in this notebook.\n",

    "### Fully connected and weighted\n",

    "\n",
    "In ``giotto-tda``, a non-fully connected weighted graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix in one of two possible forms:\n",
    "- a dense square array with ``np.inf`` in position $ij$ if the edge between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$ is absent.\n",
    "- a sparse matrix in which the non-stored edge weights represent absent edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notes**\n",
    "- A ``0`` in a dense array, or an explicitly stored ``0`` in a sparse matrix, does *not* denote an absent edge. It denotes an edge with weight 0, which, in a sense, means the complete opposite! See the section ***Understanding the computation*** below.\n",
    "- Dense Boolean arrays are first converted to numerical ones and then interpreted as adjacency matrices of FCW graphs. ``False`` values therefore should not be used to represent absent edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the computation \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what these persistence diagrams are telling us about the input weighted graphs, we briefly explain the **clique complex (or flag complex) filtration** procedure underlying the computations in ``VietorisRipsPersistence`` when ``metric=\"precomputed\"``, via an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a special case of a weighted graph with adjacency matrix as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the diagonal entries (\"vertex weights\") are all zero;\n",
    "- all off-diagonal entries (edge weights) are non-negative;\n",
    "- some edge weights are infinite (or very very large).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can lay such a graph on the plane to visualise it, drawing only the finite edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A weighted graph](images/weighted_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure can be explained as follows: we let a parameter $\\varepsilon$ start at 0, and as we increase it all the way to infinity we keep considering the instantaneous subgraphs made of a) all the vertices in the original graph, and b) those edges whose weight is less than or equal to the current $\\varepsilon$. We also promote these subgraphs to more general structures called **(simplicial) complexes** that, alongside vertices and edges, also possess $k$**-simplices**, i.e. selected subsets of $k + 1$ vertices (a 2-simplex is an abstract \"triangle\", a 3-simplex an abstract \"tetrahedron\", etc). Our criterion is this: for each integer $k \\geq 2$, all $(k + 1)$-cliques in each instantaneous subgraph are declared to be the $k$-simplices of the subgraph's associated complex. By definition, the $0$-simplices are the vertices and the $1$-simplices are the available edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\varepsilon$ increases from 0 (included) to infinity, we record the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many new **connected components** are created because of the appearance of vertices (in this example, all vertices \"appear\" in one go at $\\varepsilon = 0$, by definition!), or merge because of the appearance of new edges.\n",
    "2. How many new 1-dimensional \"holes\", 2-dimensional \"cavities\", or more generally $d$-dimensional **voids** are created in the instantaneous complex. A hole, cavity, or $d$-dimensional void is such only if there is no collection of \"triangles\", \"tetrahedra\", or $(d + 1)$-simplices which the void is the \"boundary\" of. *Note*: Although the edges of a triangle *alone* \"surround a hole\", these cannot occur in our particular construction because the \"filling\" triangle is also declared present in the complex when all its edges are.\n",
    "3. How many $d$-dimensional voids which were present at earlier values of $\\epsilon$ are \"filled\" by $(d + 1)$-simplices which just appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of recording the full topological history of the graph across all edge weights is called (Vietoris-Rips) **persistent homology**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start at $\\varepsilon = 0$: Some edges had zero weight in our graph, so they already appear!\n",
    "\n",
    "![$\\varepsilon = 0$](images/clique_complex_0_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 9 connected components, and nothing much else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to and including $\\varepsilon = 2$, a few more edges are added which make some of the connected components merge together but do not create any hole, triangles, or higher cliques. Let us look at $\\varepsilon = 3$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![$\\varepsilon = 3$](images/clique_complex_3_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The newly arrived edges reduce the number of connected components further, but more interestingly they create a 1D hole!\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of a \"higher\"-simplex, at $\\varepsilon = 4$ we get our first triangle:\n",
    "\n",
    "![$\\varepsilon = 4$](images/clique_complex_4_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At $\\varepsilon = 5$, our 1D hole is filled:\n",
    "\n",
    "![$\\varepsilon = 5$](images/clique_complex_5_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At $\\varepsilon = 8$, two new 1D holes appear:\n",
    "\n",
    "![$\\varepsilon = 8$](images/clique_complex_8_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, at $\\varepsilon = 9$, some more connected components merge, but no new voids are either created or destroyed:\n",
    "\n",
    "![$\\varepsilon = 9$](images/clique_complex_9_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can stop as we have reached the maximum value of $\\varepsilon$, beyond which nothing will change: there is only one connected component left, but there are also two 1D holes which will never get filled.\n",

Making all these entries equal to zero means, as in the example above, that all vertices appear simultaneously at $\\varepsilon = 0$. Generally however, different vertices can be declared to \"appear\" at different values, and even at negative ones.\n",

    "The Vietoris-Rips procedure for point clouds is often depicted as a process of growing balls of ever increasing radius $r$ around each point, and drawing edges between two points whenever their two respective $r$-balls touch for the first time.

The conventions on input data are the same as in the undirected case, cf. section ***Non-fully connected weighted graphs*** above.\n",

    "The ideas and constructions underlying the algorithm in this case are very similar to the ones described above for the undirected case. Again, we threshold the graph and its directed edges according to an ever-increasing parameter and the edge weights. And again we look at \"cliques\" of vertices to define simplices and hence a \"complex\" for each value of the parameter. The main difference is that here simplices are **ordered** sets (tuples) of vertices, and that in each instantaneous complex the \"clique\" $(v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_k)$ is a $k$-simplex if and only if, for each $i < j$, $(v_i, v_j)$ is a currently present directed edge.\n",
