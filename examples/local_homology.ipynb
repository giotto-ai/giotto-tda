For a graph, the number of 'loops' is the number of cycles of that graph. In the case of connected graphs this is equal to $1-\\chi(G)$, where $\\chi(G)=|V|-|E|$ is the Euler characteristic of the graph, and $|V|$ and $|E|$ are the number of vertices and edges respectively. \n",

Our algorithm cones off the points that lie in between the first and second radii, as depicted below.\n",
