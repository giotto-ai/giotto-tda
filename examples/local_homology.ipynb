For a graph, the number of 'loops' is the number of cycles of that graph. In the case of connected graphs this is equal to $1-\\chi(G)$, where $\\chi(G)=|V|-|E|$ is the Euler characteristic of the graph, and $|V|$ and $|E|$ are the number of vertices and edges respectively. \n",

We thus keep points that are closer than the second radius (either a distance from the point for the RadiusLocalVietrosiRips transformer, or the closest neighbors for the KNeighborsVietorisRips transformer).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is the one making loops reflect dimensionality. From a line, how can we obtain a loop? We stick the two ends of the line together!

Our algorithm cones off the points that lie in between the first and second radii, as depicted below.\n",
