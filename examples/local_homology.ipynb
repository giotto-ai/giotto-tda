    "As the mathematics behind this algorithm is quite involved, we give an explanation for one-dimensional examples. We also give a picture for the process in a 2-dimensional example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central theme in topology is the study of properties that are invariant under deformation. A popular one-dimensional invariant is the number of 'loops' in the space. For a graph, the number of 'loops' is the number of cycles of that graph. In the case of connected graphs this is equal to $1 - \\chi(G)$, where $\\chi(G) = |V| - |E|$ is the *Euler characteristic* of the graph, and $|V|$ and $|E|$ are the number of vertices and edges respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider *trees*, which are a particular kind of graph. Although all trees have Euler characteristic equal to $1$, they can have very different local structure. By computing this local structure, we can discriminate between topologically distinct trees (or graphs, or higher-dimensional objects). In order to compute the local structure around each data point with standard algorithms for point clouds or dissimilarity matrices, such as the highly-optimised routines used by ``VietorisRipsPersistence``, we use a few tricks!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to discard points that are far away from the point under consideration, since they do not affect the local geometry around it. We thus only keep points that are \"not far\" from our point, according to a certain criterion. For the ``RadiusLocalVietorisRips`` transformer, the criterion is that the distance from the chosen point should be less than or equal to the second entry in the ``radii`` pair. For the ``KNeighborsVietorisRips`` transformer, we only include the $k$-nearest neighbors to our chosen point, where $k$ is the second entry in the ``n_neighbors`` pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is the one making loops reflect dimensionality. From a line, how can we obtain a loop? We stick the two ends of the line together! This trick can be thought of as \"coning off\" the endpoints: adding an extra point and linking some points (the furthest points) to this extra point. In the case of the ``RadiusLocalVietorisRips`` transformer, our algorithm cones off the points that lie in between the first and second entries in ``radii``, as depicted below. For the ``KNeighborsVietorisRips`` transformer, we cone off in an analogous way according to the ``n_neighbors`` pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the Euler characteristic of the result of applying this procedure to an \"X shape\" graph, which could be the local neighborhood around a point in a larger graph? The result after \"coning off\" has two vertices (at the intersection points) and 4 edges, so the Euler characteristic is $-2$! This reflects the complexity at the point that we are considering. (Notice also that a loop has Euler characteristic $0$, and a triple intersection will give Euler characteristic $-1$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a 2-dimensional example of this procedure, consider a disk (again, you can think of this as the local neighbourhood around a chosen point). By coning off the outer part of this disk, we end up with a sphere. And a sphere's only non-trivial topological features are 2-dimensional."
