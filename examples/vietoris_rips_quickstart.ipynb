    "# Topological feature extraction using ``VietorisRipsPersistence`` and ``PersistenceEntropy``\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we showcase the ease of use of one of the core components of ``giotto-tda``: ``VietorisRipsPersistence``, along with vectorisation methods. We first list steps in a typical, topological-feature extraction routine and then show to encapsulate them with a standard ``scikit-learn``–like pipeline.\n",

    "Let's begin by generating 3D point clouds of spheres and tori, along with a label of 0 (1) for each sphere (torus). We also add noise to each point cloud, whose effect is to displace the points sampling the surfaces by a random amount in a random direction. **Note**: You will need the auxiliary module [generate_datasets.py](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda/blob/master/examples/data/generate_datasets.py) to run this cell. You can change the second argument of `generate_point_clouds` to obtain a finer or coarser sampling, or tune the level of noise via the third."

    "**Important note**: `VietorisRipsPersistence`, and all other \"persistence homology\" transformers in `gtda.homology`, expect input in the form of a 3D array or, in some cases, a list of 2D arrays. For each entry in the input (here, for each point cloud in `point_clouds`) they compute a topological summary which is also a 2D array, and then stack all these summaries into a single output 3D array. So, in our case, `diagrams[i]` represents the topology of `point_clouds[i]`. `diagrams[i]` is interpreted as follows:\n",
    "- Each row is a triplet describing a single topological feature found in `point_clouds[i]`.\n",
    "- The first and second entries (respectively) in the triplet denote the values of the \"filtration parameter\" at which the feature appears or disappears respectively. They are referred to as the \"birth\" and \"death\" values of the feature (respectively). The meaning of \"filtration parameter\" depends on the specific transformer, but in the case of `VietorisRipsPersistence` on point clouds it has the interpretation of a length scale.\n",
    "- A topological feature can be a connected component, 1D hole/loop, 2D cavity, or more generally $d$-dimensional \"void\" which exists in the data at scales between its birth and death values. The integer $d$ is the *homology dimension* (or degree) of the feature and is stored as the third entry in the triplet. In this example, the shapes should have 2D cavities so we explicitly tell `VietorisRipsPersistence` to look for these by using the `homology_dimensions` parameter!\n",
    "\n",
    "If we make one scatter plot per available homology dimension, and plot births and deaths as x- and y-coordinates of points in 2D, we end up with a 2D representation of `diagrams[i]`, and the reason why it is called a persistence *diagram*:"
