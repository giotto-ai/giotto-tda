    """:ref:`Persistence diagrams <persistence_diagram>` resulting from
    :ref:`Vietoris–Rips filtrations
    <vietoris-rips_complex_and_vietoris-rips_persistence>`.

    Given a :ref:`point cloud <distance_matrices_and_point_clouds>` in
    Euclidean space, an abstract :ref:`metric space
    <distance_matrices_and_point_clouds>` encoded by a distance matrix, or the
    adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected graph, information about the
    appearance and disappearance of topological features (technically,
    :ref:`homology classes <homology_and_cohomology>`) of various dimensions
    and at different scales is summarised in the corresponding persistence
    diagram.

    **Important note**:

        - Persistence diagrams produced by this class must be interpreted with
          care due to the presence of padding triples which carry no
          information. See :meth:`transform` for additional information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric : string or callable, optional, default: ``"euclidean"``
        If set to ``"precomputed"``, input data is to be interpreted as a
        collection of distance matrices or of adjacency matrices of weighted
        undirected graphs. Otherwise, input data is to be interpreted as a
        collection of point clouds (i.e. feature arrays), and `metric`
        determines a rule with which to calculate distances between pairs of
        points (i.e. row vectors). If `metric` is a string, it must be one of
        the options allowed by :func:`scipy.spatial.distance.pdist` for its
        metric parameter, or a metric listed in
        :obj:`sklearn.pairwise.PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS`, including
        ``"euclidean"``, ``"manhattan"`` or ``"cosine"``. If `metric` is a
        callable, it should take pairs of vectors (1D arrays) as input and, for
        each two vectors in a pair, it should return a scalar indicating the
        distance/dissimilarity between them.

    metric_params : dict, optional, default: ``{}``
        Additional parameters to be passed to the distance function.

    homology_dimensions : list or tuple, optional, default: ``(0, 1)``
        Dimensions (non-negative integers) of the topological features to be
        detected.

    coeff : int prime, optional, default: ``2``
        Compute homology with coefficients in the prime field
        :math:`\\mathbb{F}_p = \\{ 0, \\ldots, p - 1 \\}` where :math:`p`
        equals `coeff`.

    collapse_edges : bool, optional, default: ``False``
        Whether to run the edge collapse algorithm in [2]_ prior to the
        persistent homology computation (see the Notes). Can reduce the runtime
        dramatically when the data or the maximum homology dimensions are
        large.

    max_edge_length : float, optional, default: ``numpy.inf``
        Maximum value of the Vietoris–Rips filtration parameter. Points whose
        distance is greater than this value will never be connected by an edge,
        and topological features at scales larger than this value will not be
        detected.

    infinity_values : float or None, default: ``None``
        Which death value to assign to features which are still alive at
        filtration value `max_edge_length`. ``None`` means that this death
        value is declared to be equal to `max_edge_length`.

    reduced_homology : bool, optional, default: ``True``
       If ``True``, the earliest-born triple in homology dimension 0 which has
       infinite death is discarded from each diagram computed in
       :meth:`transform`.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional, default: ``None``
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. ``None`` means 1 unless
        in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    infinity_values_ : float
        Effective death value to assign to features which are still alive at
        filtration value `max_edge_length`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : ndarray or list of length n_samples
            Input data representing a collection of point clouds if `metric`
            was not set to ``"precomputed"``, and of distance matrices or
            adjacency matrices of weighted undirected graphs otherwise. Can be
            either a 3D ndarray whose zeroth dimension has size ``n_samples``,
            or a list containing ``n_samples`` 2D ndarrays/sparse matrices.
            Point cloud arrays have shape ``(n_points, n_dimensions)``, and if
            `X` is a list these shapes can vary between point clouds. If
            `metric` was set to ``"precomputed"``, then:

                - Diagonal entries indicate vertex weights, i.e. the filtration
                  parameters at which vertices appear.
                - If entries of `X` are dense, only their upper diagonal
                  portions (including the diagonal) are considered.
                - If entries of `X` are sparse, they do not need to be upper
                  diagonal or symmetric. If only one of entry (i, j) and (j, i)
                  is stored, its value is taken as the weight of the undirected
                  edge {i, j}. If both are stored, the value in the upper
                  diagonal is taken. Off-diagonal entries which are not
                  explicitly stored are treated as infinite, indicating absent
                  edges.
                - Entries of `X` should be compatible with a filtration, i.e.
                  the value at index (i, j) should be no smaller than the
                  values at diagonal indices (i, i) and (j, j).

        y : None

@adapt_fit_transform_docs
class WeightedRipsPersistence(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin, PlotterMixin):
    """:ref:`Persistence diagrams <persistence_diagram>` resulting from
    :ref:`weighted Vietoris–Rips filtrations <TODO>` as in [3]_.

    Given a :ref:`point cloud <distance_matrices_and_point_clouds>` in
    Euclidean space, an abstract :ref:`metric space
    <distance_matrices_and_point_clouds>` encoded by a distance matrix, or the
    adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected graph, information about the
    appearance and disappearance of topological features (technically,
    :ref:`homology classes <homology_and_cohomology>`) of various dimensions
    and at different scales is summarised in the corresponding persistence
    diagram.

    Weighted (Vietoris–)Rips filtrations can be useful to highlight topological
    features against outliers and noise. Among them, the distance-to-measure
    (DTM) filtration is particularly suited to point clouds due to several
    favourable properties. This implementation follows the general framework
    described in [3]_. The idea is that, starting from a way to compute vertex
    weights :math:`\\{w_i\\}_i` from an input point cloud/distance
    matrix/adjacency matrix, a modified adjacency matrix is determined whose
    diagonal entries are the :math:`\\{w_i\\}_i`, and whose edge weights are

    .. math:: w_{ij} = \\begin{cases} \\max\\{ w_i, w_j \\} &\\text{if }
       2\\mathrm{dist}_{ij} \\leq |w_i^p - w_j^p|^{\\frac{1}{p}}, \\\\
       t &\\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}

    where :math:`t` is the only positive root of

    .. math:: 2 \\mathrm{dist}_{ij} = (t^p - w_i^p)^\\frac{1}{p} +
       (t^p - w_j^p)^\\frac{1}{p}

    and :math:`p` is a parameter (see `metric_params`). The modified adjacency
    matrices are then treated exactly as in :class:`VietorisRipsPersistence`.

    **Important notes**:

        - Vertex and edge weights are twice the ones in [3]_ so that the same
          results as :class:`VietorisRipsPersistence` are obtained when all
          vertex weights are zero.
        - Persistence diagrams produced by this class must be interpreted with
          care due to the presence of padding triples which carry no
          information. See :meth:`transform` for additional information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric : string or callable, optional, default: ``"euclidean"``
        If set to ``"precomputed"``, input data is to be interpreted as a
        collection of distance matrices or of adjacency matrices of weighted
        undirected graphs. Otherwise, input data is to be interpreted as a
        collection of point clouds (i.e. feature arrays), and `metric`
        determines a rule with which to calculate distances between pairs of
        points (i.e. row vectors). If `metric` is a string, it must be one of
        the options allowed by :func:`scipy.spatial.distance.pdist` for its
        metric parameter, or a metric listed in
        :obj:`sklearn.pairwise.PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS`, including
        ``"euclidean"``, ``"manhattan"`` or ``"cosine"``. If `metric` is a
        callable, it should take pairs of vectors (1D arrays) as input and, for
        each two vectors in a pair, it should return a scalar indicating the
        distance/dissimilarity between them.

    metric_params : dict, optional, default: ``{}``
        Additional parameters to be passed to the distance function.

    homology_dimensions : list or tuple, optional, default: ``(0, 1)``
        Dimensions (non-negative integers) of the topological features to be
        detected.

    weights : ``"DTM"`` or callable, optional, default: ``"DTM"``
        Function that will be applied to each input point cloud/distance
        matrix/adjacency matrix to compute a 1D array of vertex weights for the
        the modified adjacency matrices. The default ``"DTM"`` denotes the
        empirical distance-to-measure function defined, following [3]_, by

        .. math:: w(x) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{n+1} \\sum_{k=1}^n
           \\mathrm{dist}(x, x_k)^r\\right)^{1/r}.

        Here, :math:`\\mathrm{dist}` is the distance metric used, :math:`x_k`
        is the :math:`k`-th :math:`\\mathrm{dist}`-nearest neighbour of
        :math:`x` (:math:`x` is not considered a neighbour of itself),
        :math:`n` is the number of nearest neighbors to include, and :math:`r`
        is a parameter (see `weight_params`). If a callable, it must return
        non-negative 1D arrays.

    weight_params : dict, optional, default: ``{}``
        Additional parameters for the weighted filtration. ``"p"`` determines
        the power to be used in computing edge weights from vertex weights. It
        can be one of ``1``, ``2`` or ``np.inf`` and defaults to ``1``. If
        `weights` is ``"DTM"``, the additional keys ``"r"`` (default: ``2``)
        and ``"n_neighbors"`` (default: ``3``) are available (see `weights`,
        where the latter corresponds to :math:`n`).

    coeff : int prime, optional, default: ``2``
        Compute homology with coefficients in the prime field
        :math:`\\mathbb{F}_p = \\{ 0, \\ldots, p - 1 \\}` where :math:`p`
        equals `coeff`.

    collapse_edges : bool, optional, default: ``False``
        Whether to run the edge collapse algorithm in [2]_ prior to the
        persistent homology computation (see the Notes). Can reduce the runtime
        dramatically when the data or the maximum homology dimensions are
        large.

    max_edge_weight : float, optional, default: ``numpy.inf``
        Maximum value of the filtration parameter in the modified adjacency
        matrix. Edges with weight greater than this value will be considered
        absent.

    infinity_values : float or None, default: ``None``
        Which death value to assign to features which are still alive at
        filtration value `max_edge_weight`. ``None`` means that this death
        value is declared to be equal to `max_edge_weight`.

    reduced_homology : bool, optional, default: ``True``
       If ``True``, the earliest-born triple in homology dimension 0 which has
       infinite death is discarded from each diagram computed in

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : ndarray or list of length n_samples
            Input data representing a collection of point clouds if `metric`
            was not set to ``"precomputed"``, and of distance matrices or
            adjacency matrices of weighted undirected graphs otherwise. Can be
            either a 3D ndarray whose zeroth dimension has size ``n_samples``,
            or a list containing ``n_samples`` 2D ndarrays/sparse matrices.
            Point cloud arrays have shape ``(n_points, n_dimensions)``, and if
            `X` is a list these shapes can vary between point clouds. If
            `metric` was set to ``"precomputed"``, then:

                - All entries of `X` should not contain infinities or negative
                  values (contrary to :class:`VietorisRipsPersistence`).
                - The diagonals of entries of `X` are ignored (after the vertex
                  weights are computed, when `weights` is a callable).
                - If entries of `X` are dense, only their upper diagonal
                  portions are considered.
                - If entries of `X` are sparse, they do not need to be upper
                  diagonal or symmetric. If only one of entry (i, j) and (j, i)
                  is stored, its value is taken as the weight of the undirected
                  edge {i, j}. If both are stored, the value in the upper
                  diagonal is taken. Off-diagonal entries which are not
                  explicitly stored are treated as infinite, indicating absent

                  diagonal or symmetric. If only one of entry (i, j) and (j, i)
                  is stored, its value is taken as the weight of the undirected
                  edge {i, j}. If both are stored, the value in the upper

        plotly_params : dict or None, optional, default: ``None``

    """:ref:`Persistence diagrams <persistence_diagram>` resulting from
    :ref:`Sparse Vietoris–Rips filtrations
    <vietoris-rips_complex_and_vietoris-rips_persistence>`.

    Given a :ref:`point cloud <distance_matrices_and_point_clouds>` in
    Euclidean space, or an abstract :ref:`metric space
    <distance_matrices_and_point_clouds>` encoded by a distance matrix,
    information about the appearance and disappearance of topological features
    (technically, :ref:`homology classes <homology_and_cohomology>`) of various
    dimensions and at different scales is summarised in the corresponding
    persistence diagram.

    **Important note**:

        - Persistence diagrams produced by this class must be interpreted with
          care due to the presence of padding triples which carry no
          information. See :meth:`transform` for additional information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric : string or callable, optional, default: ``"euclidean"``
        If set to ``"precomputed"``, input data is to be interpreted as a
        collection of distance matrices. Otherwise, input data is to be
        interpreted as a collection of point clouds (i.e. feature arrays), and
        `metric` determines a rule with which to calculate distances between
        pairs of instances (i.e. rows) in these arrays. If `metric` is a
        string, it must be one of the options allowed by
        :func:`scipy.spatial.distance.pdist` for its metric parameter, or a
        metric listed in :obj:`sklearn.pairwise.PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS`,
        including "euclidean", "manhattan", or "cosine". If `metric` is a
        callable, it is called on each pair of instances and the resulting
        value recorded. The callable should take two arrays from the entry in
        `X` as input, and return a value indicating the distance between them.

    homology_dimensions : list or tuple, optional, default: ``(0, 1)``
        Dimensions (non-negative integers) of the topological features to be
        detected.

    coeff : int prime, optional, default: ``2``
        Compute homology with coefficients in the prime field
        :math:`\\mathbb{F}_p = \\{ 0, \\ldots, p - 1 \\}` where :math:`p`
        equals `coeff`.

    epsilon : float between 0. and 1., optional, default: ``0.1``
        Parameter controlling the approximation to the exact Vietoris–Rips
        filtration. If set to `0.`, :class:`SparseRipsPersistence` leads to the
        same results as :class:`VietorisRipsPersistence` but is slower.

    max_edge_length : float, optional, default: ``numpy.inf``
        Maximum value of the Sparse Rips filtration parameter. Points whose
        distance is greater than this value will never be connected by an edge,
        and topological features at scales larger than this value will not be
        detected.

    infinity_values : float or None, default: ``None``
        Which death value to assign to features which are still alive at
        filtration value `max_edge_length`. ``None`` means that this death
        value is declared to be equal to `max_edge_length`.

    reduced_homology : bool, optional, default: ``True``
       If ``True``, the earliest-born triple in homology dimension 0 which has
       infinite death is discarded from each diagram computed in
       :meth:`transform`.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional, default: ``None``
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. ``None`` means 1 unless
        in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    infinity_values_ : float
        Effective death value to assign to features which are still alive at
        filtration value `max_edge_length`. Set in :meth:`fit`.

        X : ndarray or list of length n_samples
            Input data representing a collection of point clouds if `metric`

            `metric` was set to ``"precomputed"``, each entry of `X` should be

class WeakAlphaPersistence(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin, PlotterMixin):
    """:ref:`Persistence diagrams <persistence_diagram>` resulting from
    :ref:`weak alpha filtrations <TODO>`.

    Given a :ref:`point cloud <distance_matrices_and_point_clouds>` in
    Euclidean space, information about the appearance and disappearance of
    topological features (technically, :ref:`homology classes
    <homology_and_cohomology>`) of various dimensions and at different scales
    is summarised in the corresponding persistence diagram.

    The weak alpha filtration of a point cloud is defined to be the
    :ref:`Vietoris–Rips filtration
    <vietoris-rips_complex_and_vietoris-rips_persistence>` of the sparse matrix
    of Euclidean distances between neighbouring vertices in the Delaunay
    triangulation of the point cloud. In low dimensions, computing the
    persistent homology of this filtration can be much faster than computing
    Vietoris–Rips persistent homology via :class:`VietorisRipsPersistence`.

    **Important note**:

        - Persistence diagrams produced by this class must be interpreted with
          care due to the presence of padding triples which carry no
          information. See :meth:`transform` for additional information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    homology_dimensions : list or tuple, optional, default: ``(0, 1)``
        Dimensions (non-negative integers) of the topological features to be
        detected.

    coeff : int prime, optional, default: ``2``
        Compute homology with coefficients in the prime field
        :math:`\\mathbb{F}_p = \\{ 0, \\ldots, p - 1 \\}` where :math:`p`
        equals `coeff`.

    max_edge_length : float, optional, default: ``numpy.inf``
        Maximum value of the Vietoris–Rips filtration parameter. Points whose
        distance is greater than this value will never be connected by an edge,
        and topological features at scales larger than this value will not be
        detected.

    infinity_values : float or None, default: ``None``
        Which death value to assign to features which are still alive at
        filtration value `max_edge_length`. ``None`` means that this death
        value is declared to be equal to `max_edge_length`.

    reduced_homology : bool, optional, default: ``True``
       If ``True``, the earliest-born triple in homology dimension 0 which has
       infinite death is discarded from each diagram computed in
       :meth:`transform`.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional, default: ``None``
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. ``None`` means 1 unless
        in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    infinity_values_ : float

class FlagserPersistence(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin, PlotterMixin):
    """:ref:`Persistence diagrams <persistence_diagram>` resulting from
    :ref:`filtrations <filtered_complex>` of :ref:`directed or undirected flag
    complexes <clique_and_flag_complexes>` [1]_.

    Given a weighted directed or undirected graph, information about the
    appearance and disappearance of topological features (technically,
    :ref:`homology classes <homology_and_cohomology>`) of various dimension and
    at different scales is summarised in the corresponding persistence diagram.

    **Important note**:

        - Persistence diagrams produced by this class must be interpreted with
          care due to the presence of padding triples which carry no
          information. See :meth:`transform` for additional information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    homology_dimensions : list or tuple, optional, default: ``(0, 1)``
        Dimensions (non-negative integers) of the topological features to be
        detected.

    directed : bool, optional, default: ``True``
        If ``True``, :meth:`transform` computes the persistence diagrams of the
        filtered directed flag complexes arising from the input collection of
        weighted directed graphs. If ``False``, :meth:`transform` computes the
        persistence diagrams of the filtered undirected flag complexes obtained
        by regarding all input weighted graphs as undirected, and:

        - if `max_edge_weight` is ``numpy.inf``, it is sufficient to pass a
          collection of (dense or sparse) upper-triangular matrices;
        - if `max_edge_weight` is finite, it is recommended to pass either a
          collection of symmetric dense matrices, or a collection of sparse
          upper-triangular matrices.

    filtration : string, optional, default: ``"max"``
        Algorithm determining the filtration values of higher order simplices
        from the weights of the vertices and edges. Possible values are:
        ["dimension", "zero", "max", "max3", "max_plus_one", "product", "sum",
        "pmean", "pmoment", "remove_edges", "vertex_degree"]

    coeff : int prime, optional, default: ``2``
        Compute homology with coefficients in the prime field
        :math:`\\mathbb{F}_p = \\{ 0, \\ldots, p - 1 \\}` where :math:`p`
        equals `coeff`.

    max_edge_weight : float, optional, default: ``numpy.inf``
        Maximum edge weight to be considered in the filtration. All edge
        weights greater than this value will be considered as absent from the
        filtration and topological features at scales larger than this value
        will not be detected.

    infinity_values : float or None, default: ``None``
        Which death value to assign to features which are still alive at
        filtration value `max_edge_weight`. ``None`` means that this death
        value is declared to be equal to `max_edge_weight`.

    reduced_homology : bool, optional, default: ``True``
       If ``True``, the earliest-born triple in homology dimension 0 which has
       infinite death is discarded from each diagram computed in
       :meth:`transform`.

    max_entries : int, optional, default: ``-1``
        Number controlling the degree of precision in the matrix reductions
        performed by the the backend. Corresponds to the parameter
        ``approximation`` in :func:`pyflagser.flagser_weighted` and
        :func:`pyflagser.flagser_unweighted`. Increase for higher precision,
        decrease for faster computation. A good value is often ``100000`` in
        hard problems. A negative value computes highest possible precision.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional, default: ``None``
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. ``None`` means 1 unless
        in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
        processors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    infinity_values_ : float
        Effective death value to assign to features which are still alive at
        filtration value `max_edge_weight`.

        Parameters

        X : ndarray or list of length n_samples
            Input collection of adjacency matrices of weighted directed or
            undirected graphs. Can be either a 3D ndarray whose zeroth
            dimension has size ``n_samples``, or a list containing

            matrix, diagonal elements are vertex weights and off-diagonal
            elements are edge weights. It is assumed that a vertex weight
            cannot be larger than the weight of the edges it forms. The way
            zero values are handled depends on the format of the matrix. If the
            matrix is a dense ``numpy.ndarray``, zero values denote
            zero-weighted edges. If the matrix is a sparse ``scipy.sparse``
            matrix, explicitly stored off-diagonal zeros and all diagonal zeros
